  Deprecating JSON Web Algorithm (JWA) "none" from JSON Web Signatures
                                 (JWS).
                  draft-mmiller-curdle-algnone-goaway

Abstract

   A JSON Web Signature (JWS) can be generated that lacks any integrity
   protection of the payload (sometimes called "unprotected JWS").  The
   "none" algorithm provides no security properties, and has been mis-
   implemented and mis-used that has demonstrable exploits and
   vulnerabilities in the real world.  This document deprecates the use
   of "none".

1.  Introduction

   JWS [RFC7515] signature algorithm "none" in [RFC7517] is bad.  It
   should go away.  Make it go away.

2.  Terminology

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting, when they are capitalized, they have
   the special meaning described in [RFC2119].

3.  Security Considerations

   Making "alg":"none" go away mitigates some vulnerabilities and
   exploits.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Make it go away.
